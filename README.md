## More about the Project

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a code. This can be achieved by using various algorithms and keys. Cryptography is used to protect information, including communication, sensitive data, and passwords. It is also used to create digital signatures for verifying the authenticity of digital documents and transactions.

## Types of Cryptography:

Symmetric Cryptography: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric Cryptography: Uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.
Uses of Cryptography:

Secure Communication: Protects communication channels like emails, instant messaging, and online transactions.
Password Protection: Protects sensitive information stored on devices and servers.
Digital Signatures: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and transactions.

## Applications of Cryptography:

Military and Government: Used to secure classified information.
Banking and Finance: Protects financial transactions and customer data.
Healthcare: Protects sensitive patient information.
Cryptography is a critical component in keeping information secure in the digital age.

This project should handle the encryption and decryption of messages and files.

The following algorithms will be implemented
- Vigen√®re
- Vernam
- Transposition
- Own algorithm
