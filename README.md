# Cryptography

## More about the Project
- Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. It is closely associated to encryption, which is the act of scrambling ordinary text into what's known as ciphertext and then back again upon arrival.
- This project should handle the encryption and decryption of messages and files.


The following algorithms will be implemented
- Vigen√®re
- Vernam
- Transposition
- Own algorithm
