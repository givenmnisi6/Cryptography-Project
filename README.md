# Cipher Shield

## More about the Project

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a code. This can be achieved by using various algorithms and keys. Cryptography is used to protect information, including communication, sensitive data, and passwords. It is also used to create digital signatures for verifying the authenticity of digital documents and transactions.

## Types of Cryptography

Symmetric Cryptography: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric Cryptography: Uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.

## Uses of Cryptography:

Secure Communication: Protects communication channels like emails, instant messaging, and online transactions.
Password Protection: Protects sensitive information stored on devices and servers.
Digital Signatures: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and transactions.

## To Do
This project should handle the encryption and decryption of messages and files.

The following algorithms will be implemented
- Vigen√®re
- Vernam
- Transposition
- Own algorithm (BnG In-House)
