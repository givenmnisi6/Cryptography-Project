# Cipher Shield

## Project Overview

Cipher Shield is a project focused on the implementation of cryptography techniques to enhance information security. Cryptography involves the conversion of data into a coded form to ensure confidentiality and integrity. This is achieved through the use of algorithms and keys. Cryptography finds application in safeguarding sensitive data, communications, and passwords. It also plays a role in creating digital signatures to verify the authenticity of digital documents and transactions.

## Types of Cryptography

There are two main types of cryptography:

1. Symmetric Cryptography: Involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption.
2. Asymmetric Cryptography: Utilizes a pair of keys, one for encryption and another for decryption.

## Applications of Cryptography

Cryptography serves various purposes, including:

- **Secure Communication:** Protects communication channels like emails, instant messaging, and online transactions.
- **Password Protection:** Safeguards sensitive information stored on devices and servers.
- **Digital Signatures:** Verifies the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and transactions.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to create a system for encrypting and decrypting messages and files. The following algorithms will be implemented:

- Vigen√®re
- Vernam
- Transposition
- Custom Algorithm (BnG In-House)
